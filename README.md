### How to test

You can run the tests directly from the browser. To do so, first click the accordion on the top left hand side of the page, select 'Random Quote Machine' from the drop down menu and then click the 'Run Tests' button. To view the tests click the button below 'Run tests' which should be green having passed all tests and should have the text 'Tests 12/12'. If this is not the case, please refresh the page and run the tests again.
